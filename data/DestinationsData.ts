        detail: `The Lake Tana area was important in the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in
            view of its role in maintaining the Christian faith against contemporary pressures, and
            the rise of the Solomonic Dynasty which patronized the building of churches and
            monasteries. Many of the earliest manuscripts and precious examples of ecclesiastical art as well as
            royal objects were safely stored in their treasuries. At the same time, new religious arts
            were developed and displayed in the churches. The oldest of these forty or so churches
            have their origins in the fourteenth century. They reflect the native building tradition in
            their round shape, materials and building techniques. Each one consists of three parts:
            the inner sanctuary, the inner ambulatory and the outer ambulatory. The outside walls
            of the sanctuary are usually covered with magnificent paintings. Seven of the most
            accessible and representative of these churches, still serving their original function, have
            been selected for the international campaign: Kebran Gabriel, Ura Kidane Mehret,
            Narga Selassie, Daga Estifanos, Medhane Alem of Rema, Kota Maryam and Mertola

            hewn stones, it’s reputedly the work of an Indian architect and shows an unusual
            synthesis of Indian, Portuguese, Moorish and Aksumite influences. The main floor was
            used as dining halls and a formal reception area. Note the wall reliefs, including several
            Stars of David, which trumpet Fasiladas’ link to the Solomonic dynasty. The small room
            in the northern corner boasts its original beam ceiling and some faint frescoes. On the
            1st floor, Fasiladas’ prayer room has windows in four directions, each overlooking
            Gonder’s important churches. Religious ceremonies were held on the roof, and it was
            from here that he addressed his people. Above Fasiladas’ 2nd-floor bedroomwas the watchtower, 
            from where it’s (apparently) possible to see all the way to Lake Tana.
            Behind the castle are various ruined buildings, including the kitchen (domed ceiling),
            steam bath and water cistern.`,
